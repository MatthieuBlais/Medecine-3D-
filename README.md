The importance of interaction with 3D objects has been recently reaching new higher levels with the introduction of virtual objects. The main goal is to improve the interaction with them. However, nowadays technical costs to reach such a goal are very high for most applications. This is why in the present work, a low-cost efficient and robust alternative is proposed for visualization and manipulation of 3D virtual objects.
